# Damper-Curves

Used to get compression and rebound forces for Ohlin's MKII Dampers given velocity (mm/s) and settings (physical dials on the dampers).

For first time users:
Sorry about the comments, this was also one of my first times using Julia so I have many comments that are basically notes to myself.
The main function at the end of the file has descriptions and function calls that can be commented/un-commented.
Steps to run:
1. Ensure that .csv files are in the same directory as the julia file
2. julia damper_curves.jl (will take a minute the first time)
